# STATS315B_Project

This repository contains the code for the STATS 315B project of Thomas Brink and Quinn Hollister. The GitHub repo is divided into two files:
1. Unsupervised learning file (evaluation on Wikipedia dataset that does not contain labels). Since this is the main file, it is called '315BProject.ipynb'
2. Supervised learning file (evaluation on labeled dataset)
