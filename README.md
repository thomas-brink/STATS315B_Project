# STATS315B_Project

This repository contains the code for the STATS 315B project of Thomas Brink and Quinn Hollister. The GitHub repo is divided into two files:
1. Unsupervised learning file (evaluation on Wikipedia dataset that does not contain labels). Since this is the main file, it is called '315BProject.ipynb'
2. Supervised learning file (evaluation on labeled dataset). This file is called 'Supervised_Analysis_315BProject.ipynb'

In addition, we have uploaded the pdf file of our final report for this project (STATS_315B_Project_Report.pdf).
